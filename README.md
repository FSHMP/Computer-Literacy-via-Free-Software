# Computer Literacy through Free Software

This is an attempt to write a book targetted at school students from grade Six to Nine for learning computer through Free Software. This book will be written colloboratively by more than one author, similar to how a Free Software is developed.

When we looked at the status quo of computer education at schools in India, the introduction of computer science is taught to students using non-free (or) proprietary software like Microsoft Windows and the tools associated with it.

Why we shouldn't use non-free software or why we should use Free software is out of scope of this book. If you are still interested to know about Free Software and the principle behind it, you can [read here](https://gnu.org/philosophy)
